I have decided to expand my academic website to include a bit more of my personal life. 

While my [CV](/cv/) and [Publications](/publications/) remain the core of this site, I wanted a place to share my other interests—like my board game sessions and travel logs.

I built this site using **Jekyll** and the **Minimal Mistakes** theme, hosted on GitHub Pages. It allows me to maintain full control over the content while keeping it simple and fast.

Stay tuned for more updates!
