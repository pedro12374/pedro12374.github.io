Science is my profession, but I believe that curiosity shouldn't stop at the laboratory door. Here is a glimpse of what keeps me busy when I'm not studying plasma turbulence.

## 🎲 Board Games
I am a huge fan of modern board games, especially complex "Euro-style" strategy games that require long-term planning and engine building.
* **Favorites:** Ark Nova, Scythe, Terraforming Mars, Agricola.
* **What I love:** I enjoy analyzing game mechanics and finding optimal strategies 

## 💻 Coding & Visualizations
While I use Python and Julia for work, I also enjoy coding for fun. I have a particular interest in **Data Visualization**.
* **Paraná Vibrante:** I recently developed my own color palette for scientific plots to make data more accessible and visually striking.


## 🎒 Travel & Outdoors
Living in Brazil offers amazing opportunities for nature lovers.
* **Trails & Hiking:** I try to hit the trails whenever I can.
* **Next Stop:** Rio de Janeiro (Jan 2026).

## 📷 Photography
